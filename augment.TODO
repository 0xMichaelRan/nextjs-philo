[important] There is some pages under @app that does not need user to be logged in, please add navigation menu for those pages if user is not logged in. 

aiFeatures in @d:\git\philo\nextjs-philo/components\global-footer.tsx should have zh-tw too, and all the links should prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOG_URL when used as href for the links. 

Check and set the correct value for const getIcon in @d:\git\philo\nextjs-philo/app\notifications\page.tsx for different types of notifications. Also for this page fix the Bell className="w-4 h-4" code, this bell icon above the page title is not theme-aware. 

Migrated all code from Bootstrap grid to Tailwind CSS in `D:\git\philo\nextjs-philo` project

Then check entire codebase to move all UI text values into @d:\git\philo\nextjs-philo/contexts\language-context.tsx
